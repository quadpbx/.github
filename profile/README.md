## This is QuadPBX ðŸ‘‹

QuadPBX is the new PBX from [xrobau](https://github.com/xrobau) [(Sponsor him!)](https://github.com/sponsors/xrobau).

See [PhoneBo.cx](https://github.com/phonebocx) for the forums and more information.

Currently, most of the work is in [building the OS](https://github.com/quadpbx/quadpbx-builder).

QuadPBX is designed around an *immutable* system, which makes it much harder for attackers to
compromise it.
